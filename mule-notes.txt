CLOUDHUB: It is an IPaas i.e. Integration Platform as a service.
Anypoint Fabric: It is the cloud hub’s backend infrastructure and services to automatically scale deployed Mule applications.
If we want to access runtime details of mule servers, we can use JMX. Since mule is exposing JMX if we want logs to integrated with other third-party systems like Splunk we can integrate them using JMX.
Cloud hub will provide you a worker, it is nothing but one VM on which our mule instance is running.
Old worker is working still the new one gets deployed, so there is 0 down time.
Cluster: Having more than one server working together and understanding each other.
VM can be used for cloud hub but be aware of creating of our own object store. So, in general for cloud hub we use JMS queues like rabbit, active MQ
Proxy: It monitors the traffic, it always looks at a specific target and gets their request and forward to a specific location.
Policy: it is a mechanism for enforcing filters on traffic.
API Gateway: It is a mule runtime responsible for managing proxies and governance. It is a part of mule runtime.
API Manager monitors the applied policies and API Gateway is responsible for policy enforcement. 
Client always access the proxy endpoint that is different from the implementation layer. Proxy checks the policies are met and then forward to implementation layer.
The policies are always set in user interface through a restful call. The policies are communicated to proxy through Anypoint platform agent
An API proxy can be automatically generated using API Manager.
